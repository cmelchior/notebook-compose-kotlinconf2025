# Compose Prototyping in Kotlin Notebooks

This repository contains the source code and presentation for my KotlinConf 2025 talk:
"Compose Prototyping in Kotlin Notebooks".

WARNING: Since this demo is based on a custom-built [Kotlin Kernel](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-jupyter) and 
IntelliJ version, getting this to run correctly will be probably be impossible. But hopefully it will 
still provide some insight into the final functionality once it is ready.
